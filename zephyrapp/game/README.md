# Utilities
## Setup
For many of the critical utilities to work, the following must be sourced:
- `zephyrproject/venv/bin/activate`
- `zephyrproject/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh`
- `zephyrapp/game/utils/catenv/bin/activate`
See `utils/tosenv.sh` for an example.
## Running
Utilities should always be run from the `game` directory.
