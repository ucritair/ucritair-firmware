		<h2 id="power-on">Power-On</h2>
		<p>The uCritAir ships in a protected power-off mode, to prevent draining the battery before it arrives. To turn it on for the first time, simply press the reset button with a small object such as a paperclip, and wait a moment.</p>
		<h2 id="displays">Displays</h2>
		<h3 id="e-ink">E-Ink</h3>
		<p>The uCritAir's topmost display is a non-interacive e-ink display which is used to communicate device status, air quality, gameplay metrics, and more. The e-ink display can be manually updated from the system menu.</p>
		<p>When the device is flipped upside-down, the e-ink display will flip its orientation to match.</p>
		<h3 id="lcd">LCD</h3>
		<p>The main display is a touchscreen LCD which is constantly updated in real time. It is where the action happens. All air quality and gameplay features are controlled through interfaces that appear on the LCD.</p>
		<h2 id="face buttons">Face Buttons</h2>
		<p>The D-pad, A/B buttons, and start/select buttons are used to control the uCritAir's software in a manner that will be familiar to anyone who has used a gamepad. That is, in general: D-pad is for navigation, A/B are for confirm and cancel respectively, start is for entering or exiting some overarching context, and select is for changing modes within a context.</p>
		<h2 id="usb-c port">USB-C Port</h2>
		<p>Connecting the μCritAir to a power source via the USB-C port will refill its battery.</p>
		<p>New builds of the system software are flashed to the μCritAir over the USB-C port.</p>
